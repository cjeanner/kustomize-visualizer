# Git Commit Rules

When creating a new commit (at the user's request), follow these rules.

## Commit Message Format (Best Practices)

- **Subject line**: 50 characters or less. Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature"). Capitalize and omit trailing period.
- **Blank line**: Exactly one blank line between subject and body.
- **Body**: Wrap at 72 characters. Explain what and why, not just how.
- **No merge/Squash-style prefixes** in the subject unless the project convention requires it (e.g. no "WIP:", "fix:" unless agreed).

Example:

```
Add validation for kustomization names

Reject empty or invalid names before rendering to avoid confusing
errors in the graph. Validation runs on load and on name change.
```

## Required Trailers (at the end of the message)

After the body, add a blank line, then these trailers in order:

1. **Tooling and AI**  
   One or more lines describing:
   - Tool(s) in use (e.g. Cursor, CLI, IDE)
   - Model(s) in use (e.g. model name/version if applicable)
   - AI agent(s) in use (e.g. agent or assistant name/type)

   Use a consistent label, e.g. `Tool:` / `Models:` / `AI agent(s):` or a single `Generated-with:` line. Example:

   ```
   Tool: Cursor
   Models: claude-sonnet-4, gpt-4o
   AI agent(s): Auto (Cursor)
   ```

2. **Co-author for Cursor**  
   Add a standard Git co-author trailer so Cursor is credited:

   ```
   Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursor@cursor.com>
   ```

   If the project or user uses a different Cursor co-author identity (name/email), use that instead.

## Full Example

```
Add validation for kustomization names

Reject empty or invalid names before rendering to avoid confusing
errors in the graph. Validation runs on load and on name change.

Tool: Cursor
Models: claude-sonnet-4
AI agent(s): Auto (Cursor)

Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursor@cursor.com>
```
